# predictive-machine-maintenance
In this work, to avoid or minimize the downtimes of the machines and to optimize the periodic 
maintenance operations, we are presenting method towards maintenance prediction, so we 
propose a Predictive maintenance based on machine learning because it is a method of 
improving the efficiency of a system by learning from experiences via computational methods.
